        <p>The best things in life are silly. Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. Work is for losers. A winner says 'That's on my list' and never commits to a deadline. Why is it that the nuttiest people define reality? Managers are like cats in a litter box. They instinctively shuffle things around to conceal what they've done.</p>
        <p>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I'll get my kit!</p>
        <p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Look, last night was a mistake. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

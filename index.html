        <p>The best things in life are silly. Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. Work is for losers. A winner says 'That's on my list' and never commits to a deadline. Why is it that the nuttiest people define reality? Managers are like cats in a litter box. They instinctively shuffle things around to conceal what they've done.</p>
        <p>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I'll get my kit!</p>

Also dark wizards.</p>
